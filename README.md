# Crud-Students-NodeJsAndJs

This personal project was created to challenge my logic and way of visualizing JavaScript in a broad manner.

# Backend
To start our backend project, we must ensure that Node.js version 16.16.0 LTS is installed.

### Commands
- npm install
- npm start

# Frontend
Our frontend project is based on Bootstrap 5, but it includes all the links from the official website, so we don't need to install dependencies. Just install Live Server and run our index.html or simply open our index.js file.

# Database
The name of the database is students_db. We must create it in XAMPP or any other database management system and execute the query provided within the files (students_db.sql).
